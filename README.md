# ComputerDatingbot
Designed by Team Passkart for the virtual hackathon hosted by Devpost -
A simple bot that uses Facebook's Wit.ai to interact with the user. It asks for customers' contact details. And it stores them in order to stay in touch. This is an experimental project and there is no guarantee whatsoever. The chatbot is supposed to interact with Facebook's wit.ai Natural Language Processing (NLP) servers. 
So it uses some of its data to analyze the interactions of ComputerDatingBot. Such as the the degree of confidence given to the "understanding" of the customer's message. The responses may also use various other estimators such as the sentiment evaluation. In order to use the chatbot, all you have to do is follow through to https://passkart.com/covid/hackpack/dataingbot. 
In addition, it attempts to score the overall customer performance in terms of sentimental values.
If you would like to install it on your server, you can access it from the main folder. The quickbase website offers api functionality. ComputerDatingBot is expandable to mobile apps (ios, android) This is a short video showing access to the chatbot. (https://vimeo.com/).
